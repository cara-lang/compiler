# Cara

Cara is a programming language!

Here are some of its characteristics:

* general-purpose
* functional
* pure
* immutable
* statically typed, with automatic type inference
* compiled and interpreted
* good for scripting

## Status

At the moment, Cara is in the design phase: I'm trying to figure out its features, syntax and behaviour and produce a grammar, a set of examples and end-to-end tests showing whole programs. You can see some in `examples/` and `tests/end-to-end/`.
