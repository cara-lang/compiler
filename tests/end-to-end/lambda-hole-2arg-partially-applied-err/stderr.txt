E0005: Function used with too few arguments

The function `f` was used with 1 argument, while it needs 2.

The type signature of the function is:

  f(x: Int, y: Int): Int

Note: In case you wanted to return a partially applied function, you'll need to
do that manually:

  y = (f(5,_))

main.cara:2:6
━━┓
2 ┃ y = f(5)
  ┃      ^
