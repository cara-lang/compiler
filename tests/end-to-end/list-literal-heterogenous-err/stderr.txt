E0002: List contains values of different types

Lists can only contain values of the same type.

Hint: A way to solve this is to wrap the different types in an ADT:

  type User =
    | ByName(String)
    | ById(Int)

  list = [ByName("a"), ByInt(123)]

Another common way of solving this is to use a tuple instead of a list:

  tuple = ("a", 123)

main.cara:1:10
━━┓
1 ┃ x = [1,2,"oops"]
  ┃          ^
