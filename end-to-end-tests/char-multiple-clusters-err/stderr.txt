E0016: Character contains multiple visible characters

A character contains more than one visible character. Remove some characters or
convert it to a string:

  "ab"

Note: In Cara, each character is an "Extended Grapheme Cluster"[1], and the
exact splitting algorithm is called "Unicode Text Segmentation"[2]. For example
a family emoji with three family members, considered by Cara to be one
character, will internally consist of three separate code points joined using
ZERO WIDTH JOINER:

  [ 0x1F468, 0x200D, 0x1F469, 0x200D, 0x1F466 ]
