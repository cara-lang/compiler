E0003: ADT constructor parameters with same type are missing a name

The ADT constructor contains parameters of the same type. Whenever that
happens, it's mandatory to provide names for the parameters:

  type Foo = Bar(a: Int, b: Int)

Hint: You can also wrap your types in more meaningful names; this will make
them impossible to swap by accident:

  type X = X Int
  type Y = Y Int
  type Foo = Bar(X,Y)

main.cara:1:20
━━┓
1 ┃ type Foo = Bar(Int,Int)
  ┃                    ^
