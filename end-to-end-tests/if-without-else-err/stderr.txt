E0021: If expression without an else branch

All `if` expressions need to contain the `else` branch:

  if foo then 3 else 9

Note: Sometimes when there is no good value to put into the `else` branch,
using Maybe is a good alternative:

  if foo then Just 3 else Nothing

main.cara:1:5
━━┓
1 ┃ x = if True then 3
  ┃     ^
