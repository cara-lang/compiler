E0020: Anonymous function shorthand with mixed holes

The expression contains both numbered and non-numbered holes. Convert the
non-numbered holes to numbered ones (`_` means the same thing as `_1`) or
convert the whole expression to an explicit lambda:

  \x y -> y + x

main.cara:1:12
━━┓
1 ┃ f = #(_2 + _)
  ┃            ^
