E0013: Assignment of expression to underscore

This type of assignment is not allowed. Either remove the expression or bind it
to a name:

  x = 123

Note: Since Cara is pure, the content of the expression (if not using a bang
pattern `!`) is guaranteed to not influence the rest of the program in any way
and thus is considered dead code.

main.cara:1:1
━━┓
1 ┃ _ = 123
  ┃ ^
